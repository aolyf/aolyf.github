      Hi, My name is Calvin Cox the 3rd.
      <br>
      Here and now I proclaim myself the pupal of the wiseman.
      <br>
      I make the musics.
      <br>
      <br>
      What if there was one guy on the moon.
      <br>
      Then another guy came...
      <br>
      Then the one guy killed the other guy.
      <br>
      Wouldn't that be fucked up?
      <br>
      <br>
      God I think I'm bound to get kidney stones at this rate.
      <br>
      Everytime I say I'm gunna get healthy, I don't.
      <br>
      <br>
      I should really be sleeping right now.
      <br>
      Yeah, I think I'm done.
